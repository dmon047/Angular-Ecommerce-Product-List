Creating Product Service (product.service.ts)

To create a product.service.ts file in an Angular application, 
you will need to build a service that handles the logic for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting products, 
often involving communication with a backend API. This service will typically use Angular's HttpClient to interact
with a REST API, but the implementation can vary depending on your needs.

To create the logic for the ProductComponent in Angular, you would follow a structure that allows you to display, add, 
update, and delete products using the ProductService we created earlier. Here's how you can structure your product.component.ts file.

product.component.html template might look for managing the display and interaction with products. This template supports viewing 
the list of products, adding new products, editing existing products, and deleting products.
